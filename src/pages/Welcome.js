          We're working hard to get clubhouse ready for everyone! While we wrap
          up the finishing touches, we're adding people gradually to make sure

          Anyone can join with an invite from an existing user - or reserve your
          username and we'll text you if you have a friend on the app who can
          let you in. We are so grateful you're here and can't wait to have you
          join!
